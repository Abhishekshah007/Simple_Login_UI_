# short documentation

The above code is a simple Flutter application that implements a login screen using Material Design widgets.Â  The main file main.dart contains the MyApp widget, which creates a MaterialApp and sets the home page to a scaffold with an empty AppBar and a LoginScreenWidget as the body.

The LoginScreenWidget is a stateful widget that returns a MyLoginScreen state object. The MyLoginScreen state object contains two TextEditingController objects to handle the username and password input fields. It also contains a login() function that retrieves the username and password entered by the user.

The MyLoginScreen widget returns a padding widget that contains a column widget with a series of child widgets. The first child widget is a Text widget with the "PROMACT" text displayed in blue and a font size of 30. The second child widget is a Text widget with "Log in" text displayed and a font size of 20.

The third and fourth child widgets are TextField widgets that handle the user's username and password input. The fifth child widget is an ElevatedButton widget with the "Login" text that triggers the Navigator to replace the current page with the home. MyHomePage widget.

The sixth child widget is a Row widget that contains a Text widget and a TextButton widget. The Text widget displays the text "Does not have an account?" and the TextButton widget displays the text "Sign in". The TextButton widget's onPressed property is not implemented.

Comments have been added throughout the code to improve readability and understanding.
